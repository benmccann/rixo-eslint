# `eslint-config-svelte-native`

**NOTE** This package is part of [rixo-eslint](https://github.com/rixo/rixo-eslint). Refer to the main repo's README for docs.

This configuration includes `eslint/import` plugin. It expects a project layout similar to [svelte-native-template](https://github.com/halfnelson/svelte-native-template), but it should work with most TNS + Webpack + SvelteNative projects.
